# GOC Release Schedule Guidelines

## Introduction

In an attempt to provide consistent and reliable service to the OSG Community the GOC will adhere to the following release schedule for software updates on all of the services located at and under the management of the Indiana University Operations group. This document applies only to non-critical updates, and does not include emergency maintenance causing a service outage or security updates. For guidelines for emergency service please refer to the SLA for the individual service at the ServiceLevelAgreements twiki.

## Regularly Scheduled Maintenance Windows

The GOC will conduct maintenance on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday at 9AM Indianapolis Local Time (EST or EDT) of each month for all GOC hosted services. Most releases can be done without downtime, but the hours between 9AM-3PM will be reserved. During this window services may experience intermittent outages while upgrades are performed.

## Testing Period for Releases

The GOC will release and announce a test version for ITB testing one week prior to the release date. Users are invited to review and test the upcoming changes and feature requests prior to the official release.
