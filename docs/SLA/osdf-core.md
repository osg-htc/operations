<https://osg-htc.org/operations/SLA/general/>

Security Considerations
-----------------------

If the client uses a SCITOKEN to retrieve a file, the cache may contact the redirector with the SCITOKEN to determine the origin that holds the file.  The Monitoring Collector receives messages from XRootD caches that may include DNs, though not the actual certificates and not SCITOKENS.  The monitoring collector has credentials to talk to the OSG Message Bus.  The shoveler has credentials to talk to the OSG Message Bus, and the WLCG Message Bus.
