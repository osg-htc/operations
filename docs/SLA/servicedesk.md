## Community Notification Target Response Times Based on Priority

Events that affect the OSG community will be announced to the appropriate email contact lists. Communication of this type are separated into two categories Critical and Non-Critical. Critical events will be defined as a security incident or outage to a critical service as represented at the [SLA Catalog](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/operations/blob/master/SLA/ServiceLevelAgreements).

| -------- | ------------ |
| Within two hours of event being reported | Within one business day |

## Operations Staff Troubleshooting
During normal business hours dedicated OSG Operations staff will attempt to diagnose all incoming issues and route them to the appropriate owner. Diagnosis is on a best effort basis and dependent on the current ticket load and operational responsibilities, individual operator knowledge of the OSG component to which the issue is related, and access levels on the service having issues. Routing of issues to an appropriate party is mandatory and will be based on operator knowledge and input from the customer and other OSG collaborators.

## Service Availability and Outages
The Service Desk will strive for 100% availability to respond to phone, email, and webform contact. With restrictions based on emergency conditions at the physical location of the GOC, these include weather or environmental evacuations and drills.
