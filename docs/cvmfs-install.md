# About this Document

Here we describe how to install the [cvmfs](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem) (Cern-VM file system) client.
This document is intended for system administrators who wish to install
this client to have access to files distributed by cvmfs servers via HTTP.

# Applicable Versions

This document addresses installation instructions for the latest version of cvmfs, which is only available in OSG 3.3 (supported OS versions: EL6 and EL7). OSG 3.2 (supported OS versions: EL5 and EL6) only receives security updates so it does not have the latest cvmfs version. The installation instructions for the older version are the same, but the verification results will be different as noted below.

# Requirements

## Host and OS

   * OS is supported. See section about [applicable versions](#applicable-versions) above for differences in supported EL versoins.
   * Root access
   * autofs should be installed
   * fuse should be installed (or will be as part of the installation)
   * Sufficient (~20GB+20%) cache space reserved, preferably in a separate filesystem (details [below](#configuring-cvmfs))

## Users and Groups

This installation will create one user unless it already exists:

| *User* | *Comment* |
| ------ | --------- |
| =cvmfs= | CernVM-FS service account |

The installation will also create a cvmfs group and default the cvmfs user to that group.
In addition, if the fuse rpm is not for some reason already installed, installing cvmfs will also install fuse and that will create another group:

| *Group* | *Comment* | *Group members* |
| ------- | --------- | --------------- |
| =cvmfs= | CernVM-FS service account | none |
| =fuse= | FUSE service account | =cvmfs= |


## Networking

You will need network access to a local squid server such as the [[InstallFrontierSquid][squid distributed by OSG]].
The squid will need out-bound access to cvmfs stratum 1 servers.

## Upgrading

When upgrading from a cvmfs version older than 2.1.20, delete the setting of CVMFS_SERVER_URL in =/etc/cvmfs/domain.d/cern.ch.local=. If that's the only thing in the file (which is likely) then delete the whole file.

# Install Instructions


## Installing cvmfs

The following will install cvmfs from the OSG yum repository. It will also install cern public keys as well as fuse and autofs if you do not have them, and it will install the configuration for the OSG cvmfs distribution which is called OASIS.
<pre class="rootscreen">
[root@client ~]$ yum install osg-oasis
</pre>

## Setup of fuse and automount

Create or edit =/etc/fuse.conf=. It should contain the following in order to allow fuse to do proper file ownership:
<pre class=file>
user_allow_other
</pre>

Create or edit =/etc/auto.master=. It should contain the following in order to allow cvmfs to automount:

<pre class=file>
/cvmfs /etc/auto.cvmfs
</pre>

Restart autofs to make the change take effect:
<pre class="rootscreen">
Stopping automount: %GREEN%[ OK ]%ENDCOLOR%
Starting automount: %GREEN%[ OK ]%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

## Configuring cvmfs

Create or edit =/etc/cvmfs/default.local=, a file that controls the cvmfs configuration. Below is a sample configuration, but please note that you will need to *edit the parts in %RED%red%ENDCOLOR%*. In particular, the =CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY= line below must be edited for your site.

<pre class="file">
CVMFS_REPOSITORIES="`echo $((echo oasis.opensciencegrid.org;echo cms.cern.ch;ls /cvmfs)|sort -u)|tr ' ' ,`"
CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT=%RED%20000%ENDCOLOR%
CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=%RED%"http://squid.example.com:3128"%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

CVMFS by default allows any repository to be mounted. The recommended =CVMFS_REPOSITORIES= setting is what it is above so that tools such as =cvmfs_config= and =cvmfs_talk= that use known repositories will use two common repositories plus any additional that have been mounted. You may want to choose a different set of always-known repositories. A full list of cern.ch repositories is found at http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/cvmfs/examples.

Set up a list of cvmfs HTTP proxies to retrieve from in =CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY=. If you do not have any squid at your site follow the instructions to [[InstallFrontierSquid][install squid from OSG]]. Vertical bars separating proxies means to load balance between them and try them all before continuing.
A semicolon between proxies means to try that one only after the previous ones have failed. A special proxy called DIRECT can be placed last
in the list to indicate directly connecting to servers if all other proxies fail. This is acceptable for small sites but discouraged for large sites because
of the potential load that could be put upon the stratum one servers.

Set up the cache limit in =CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT= (in MB). The recommended value for most applications is 20000 MB. This is the combined limit for all but the osgstorage.org repositories. This cache will be stored in =/var/lib/cvmfs= by default; to override the location, set =CVMFS_CACHE_BASE= in =/etc/cvmfs/default.local=. Note that an additional 1000 MB is allocated for a separate osgstorage.org repositories cache in =$CVMFS_CACHE_BASE/osgstorage=. To be safe, make sure that at least 20% more than $CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT + 1000 MB of space stays available for cvmfs in that filesystem. This is very important, since if that space is not available it can cause many I/O errors and application crashes. Many system administrators choose to put the cache space in a separate filesystem, which is a good way to manage it.


# Verifying cvmfs

After cvmfs is installed, you should be able to see the =/cvmfs= directory. But note that it will initially appear to be empty:

<pre class="screen">
</pre>

Directories within =/cvmfs= will not be mounted until you examine them. For instance:

<pre class="screen">
total 1
drwxr-xr-x 7 cvmfs cvmfs 3 Jul 7 2015 repo
total 1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cvmfs cvmfs 18 May 13 2015 cms -> /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch
total 5
drwxr-xr-x 9 cvmfs cvmfs 4096 Feb 7 2014 glast
total 6
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cvmfs cvmfs 32 Jan 19 11:40 flux -> pnfs/fnal.gov/usr/nova/data/flux
-rw-r--r-- 1 cvmfs cvmfs 49 Jan 19 11:38 new_repository
drwxr-xr-x 3 cvmfs cvmfs 4096 Jan 19 11:39 pnfs
atlas.cern.ch config-osg.opensciencegrid.org nova.osgstorage.org
cms.cern.ch glast.egi.eu oasis.opensciencegrid.org
</pre>


## Troubleshooting problems

If no directories exist under =/cvmfs/=, you can try the following steps to debug:

   * <p>Mount it manually =mkdir /mnt/cvmfs= then =mount -t cvmfs REPOSITORYNAME /mnt/cvmfs= where REPOSITORYNAME is the repository, for example config-osg.opensciencegrid.org (this is the best one to try first because other repositories require it to be mounted). If this works, then cvmfs is working, but there is a problem with automount.</p>
   * <p>If that doesn't work and doesn't give any explanatory errors, try =cvmfs_config chksetup= or =cvmfs_config showconfig REPOSITORYNAME= to verify your setup.</p>
   * <p>If chksetup reports access problems to proxies, it may be caused by access control settings in the squids.</p>
   * <p>If you have changed settings in =/etc/cvmfs/default.local=, and they do not seem to be taking effect, note that there are other configuration files that can override the settings. See the comments at the beginning of =/etc/cvmfs/default.conf= regarding the order in which configuration files are evaluated and look for old files that may have been left from a previous installation.</p>
   * <p>More things to try are in the [upstream documentation](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem/debugmount).</p>

# Starting and Stopping services

Once it is set up, cvmfs is always automatically started when one of the repositories are accessed.

cvmfs can be stopped via:
<pre class="rootscreen">
Unmounting /cvmfs/config-osg.opensciencegrid.org: OK
Unmounting /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch: OK
Unmounting /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org: OK
Unmounting /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch: OK
Unmounting /cvmfs/glast.egi.eu: OK
Unmounting /cvmfs/nova.osgstorage.org: OK
</pre>
